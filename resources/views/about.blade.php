                  <h2>Welcome to SharePair</h2>
                  <p>SharePair is a platform which provides study meeting to students who are studying at same school. If you missed some lectures or a topic is hard to understand or you have midterm or final exam, generally you have two alternatives. First, you can get help from your teachers or second, you can get help from other students.</p>
                  <p>Don't worry, you are lucky! SharePair provides you the second alternative.

Also you can create study announcement in order to get help quickly.</p>
                  
                  <p>Maybe you are helpful person and you feel happiness and are honored when you help to other people. Here is the opportunity! You can create your profile and can give some information to other students in your school, in topics that you are good at. In this way, other students who need help, can find you and arrange meeting with you considering your free-time.</p>
                  
                  <p>Nowadays, the students never meet other students who are studying in same field at upper class or lower class or even same class. SharePair also socialize the students with other students who are in their school. Maybe a study meeting can mediate a beginning of good friendship. Who knows, maybe you can find your graduation project team members.</p>

                  <h2>Rules of SharePair</h2>

                  <p>SharePair only allows students to use the platform. Also SharePair allows study meeting among students who studying at same school. Students find a pair from your school and arrange study meeting within their school boundaries. As understood, students can only register to platform with their <b>official school email.</b></p>
                  
                  <p>There are some reasons about why these rules exist:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Students already knows facilities and resources of their school and how they use them.</li>
                    <li>In same school, students' course schedules may be similar to each other such as break times. And students can find the most appropriate free-time for each other easily.</li>
                    <li>The contents of lessons are exactly the same for the students who are at same field and in this way the students can find better ways in order to study with each other.</li>
                    <li>Midterm or final exams are at same date for students in a school so the students can need help at close date to each other.</li>
                    <li>Etc.</li>
                  </ul>
